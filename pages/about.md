I started learning programming in early 2020 from my brother and I've been self-taught since. I'm interested in the craft of coding, learning how to do good work, and creating software that is sympathetic to both machines and the people that use them. My interests and curiosities tend to range widely. Right now, I'm working on things ranging from [simple web apps](https://piano.benmuth.com) to a [novel data interchange format](https://github.com/benmuth/go-muon) and a [collaborative terminal text editor](https://github.com/burntcarrot/pairpad)
