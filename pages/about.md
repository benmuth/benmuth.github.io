I'm a self taught programmer who's driven by a ceaseless curiosity to understand more about how these machines and systems which underlie daily life work. 

I'm most compelled by the engineering side of software design; the part that forces you to carefully consider goals and trade-offs, and requires deep domain knowledge to correctly make tricky technical decisions.

I believe computers still have tremendous untapped potential, both for casual users and experts alike.

I enjoy learning about distributed systems, low-level programming, new languages, networking, and more.

Outside of programming, I love cooking and sharing food with others. In between learning coding, I worked as a cook at a few Manhattan restaurants for the better part of a year. I also enjoy drawing, basketball, and drumming.
