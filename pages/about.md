I'm a self taught programmer who's driven by a ceaseless curiosity to understand more about how these machines and systems which underlie daily life work. 

I'm compelled by the engineering side of software design; the part that forces you to consider goals and tradeoffs, and requires deep domain knowledge to correctly make tricky technical decisions.

I believe computers still have tremendous untapped potential, both for casual users and experts alike.

I enjoy learning about distributed systems, low-level programming, new languages, networking, and more.

Outside of programming, I love cooking and sharing food with others. In between programming, I worked as a cook at a series of Manhattan restaurants for the better part of a year. I also enjoy drawing and basketball, and used to play the drums (I'd like to start again!).
