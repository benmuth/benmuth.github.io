  <p>To start, this blog is for me. I want a record of my projects and learnings over time. I <a href="https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/">write to think</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html">put ideas into words</a>, and to figure out what I really know and don&rsquo;t know. I want to get better at explaining and discussing technical topics.</p>
<p>This blog might also be for you. My imagined audience is me from 6 months prior. As some background, I started programming a few years ago, and I&rsquo;m going to write about things that have been interesting or confusing to me, like how a CRDT algorithm decides where to insert a character, or how WebSockets work. If that sounds interesting to you, check back soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for quantity and consistency. I&rsquo;m not going to wait for <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/scheduling-visits-from-the-muse/">visits from the muse</a>. Criticizing my own work comes naturally to me; producing and sharing my work with others doesn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of starting this blog for more than a year now, but only managed to publish my first post last month. To improve at a skill, I think that rapid iteration is more helpful than aiming for some naive idea of perfection. If I focus on quality above all, I&rsquo;ll never produce, and be slow to improve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be novel. Trying to explain my own view of an established concept will only help my understanding. I also find value in reading the same thing being explained or discussed from multiple points of view. I don&rsquo;t mind rehashing old ideas. If me from 6 months ago would have found something I wrote interesting or helpful, I consider that a success. If I focus on originality above all, I&rsquo;ll never produce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be completely correct. I&rsquo;m actually counting on being wrong sometimes, and hope to be corrected. If you have feedback or want to discuss something, please email me at <a href="mailto:benmuthalaly@gmail.com">benmuthalaly@gmail.com</a>. If I focus on perfect accuracy, I&rsquo;ll never produce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to <a href="https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-more">consume less and create more</a>.</p>
<p>This is a place to practice in public. Over time, I want my posts to be of higher quality, more interesting, and more accurate. Check back in a few years to see how I did!</p>
